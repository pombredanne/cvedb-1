title: CVE in guacamole-common-js
description: >
    Prior to 1.0.0, Apache Guacamole used a cookie for client-side storage of the user's session token. This cookie lacked the "secure" flag, which could allow an attacker eavesdropping on the network to intercept the user's session token if unencrypted HTTP requests are made to the same domain.
