description: >
    DefaultHostnameVerifier in Ldaptive (formerly vt-ldap) does not properly verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.
