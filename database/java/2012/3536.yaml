description: >
    Two XSS vulnerabilities were fixed in message list and view in the Hupa Webmail application from the Apache James project. An attacker could send a carefully crafted email to a user of Hupa which would trigger a XSS when the email was opened or when a list of messages were viewed. This issue was addressed in Hupa 0.0.3.
