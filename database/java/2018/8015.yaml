title: CVE in org.apache.orc:orc-core
description: >
    In Apache ORC 1.0.0 to 1.4.3 a malformed ORC file can trigger an endlessly recursive function call in the C++ or Java parser. The impact of this bug is most likely denial-of-service against software that uses the ORC file parser. With the C++ parser, the stack overflow might possibly corrupt the stack.
