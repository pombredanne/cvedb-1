title: CVE in django-rest-registration
description: >
    verification.py in django-rest-registration (aka Django REST Registration library) before 0.5.0 relies on a static string for signatures (i.e., the Django Signing API is misused), which allows remote attackers to spoof the verification process. This occurs because incorrect code refactoring led to calling a security-critical function with an incorrect argument.
