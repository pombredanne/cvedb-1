title: CVE in ansible
description: >
    Ansible, all ansible_engine-2.x versions and ansible_engine-3.x up to ansible_engine-3.5, was logging at the DEBUG level which lead to a disclosure of credentials if a plugin used a library that logged credentials at the DEBUG level. This flaw does not affect Ansible modules, as those are executed in a separate process.
