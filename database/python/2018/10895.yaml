title: CVE in qutebrowser
description: >
    qutebrowser before version 1.4.1 is vulnerable to a cross-site request forgery flaw that allows websites to access 'qute://*' URLs. A malicious website could exploit this to load a 'qute://settings/set' URL, which then sets 'editor.command' to a bash script, resulting in arbitrary code execution.
